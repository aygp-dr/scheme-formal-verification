Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Found syntax error preventing dependency check from running
- Error was in shebang handling - Guile requires proper block comment termination
- Fixed by adding \!# to close the #\! block comment started by shebang

Debugging/Issues:
- Initial error: "unterminated #\! ... \!# comment" at line 59 (beyond file end)
- Problem was missing \!# termination after #\!/usr/bin/env guile
- Script now executes successfully and reports system capabilities

Cleanup performed:
- Fixed executable permission issue (mode change to 755)
- Verified all required modules are available on current system
- Confirmed Guile 2.2.7 compatibility (though project targets 3.x)

Technical decisions:
- Used standard Guile shebang pattern with proper termination
- Maintained existing script logic and module requirements
- Preserved cross-version compatibility checking

Future improvements:
- Consider updating version check to accept 2.2.x as compatible
- Add more detailed module version reporting
- Consider adding optional dependency checking
