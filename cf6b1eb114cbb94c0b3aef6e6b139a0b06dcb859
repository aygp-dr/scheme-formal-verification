Context:
- Request to add project environment configuration and Emacs integration
- User needed tmux session management with project-specific Emacs setup
- Focus on Scheme development with Geiser, Guile 3, Org mode, Tramp, and Paredit

Considerations:
- Created .envrc for environment variables (PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_ROOT)
- Configured Guile load paths for proper module resolution
- Emacs config auto-installs required packages if missing
- tmux session management includes automatic cleanup of existing sessions
- Preserved existing Makefile structure while adding new functionality

Technical Decisions:
- Used guile3 binary for Geiser to ensure Guile 3.x compatibility
- Enabled Org Babel for Scheme to support literate programming
- Added project-specific keybindings for common operations
- Configured company-mode with Geiser backend for auto-completion

Implementation Issues:
- Minor permission warning on /tmp/claude-d8ec-cwd (non-blocking)
- No existing .envrc file, created new one
- Emacs config designed to work with -Q flag for clean environment

Timing:
- Implementation: ~5 minutes
- Files created: .envrc, scheme-formal-verification.el
- Files modified: Makefile
- Commit created at: $(date -Iseconds)
